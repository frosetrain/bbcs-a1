## Ideation

Categorised by complexity

1. Daily puzzles to exercise user's brain
2. Object recognition
  	- By accessing the camera, the user can take a photo of an object/person, and label them.
  	- If they forget what the object/person is, they can always let the app recognise it and provide the user with the name and any description they've labelled onto them before.
  	
_For notes and map navigation, most phones probably already have a built-in app for that_
